/**
 * Publishes records to the Platform-managed record stream, using the {@link
 * com.swirlds.common.stream.StreamAligned} contract to maintain the invariant that a new record
 * file (i.e., block) starts <b>only</b> at a consensus timestamp that was the first assigned to a
 * user transaction. This invariant makes it easy to further guarantee that the block number
 * increases if and only if a new record file begins.
 *
 * <p>This means that all the child records for a user transaction, whether top-level or scheduled,
 * will be in the same record file. In particular, all child records for a contract transaction will
 * be in the same block as the record of the top-level transaction.
 *
 * <p>It also means that all system-created records from a single call to {@code handleTransaction}
 * will be in the same record file. (Although this is less important at this time.)
